# What I (Nam) had done:
1. Redesigning the layout of the game to make it looks more consistent
2. Linking the gameplay page that I implemented to the game
3. Making the Skin Color and Speed Setting pages functional. This means that selecting a setting actually triggers a change in the gameplay, instead of doing nothing.
4. For the setting pages, I used a third-party dependency called "react-horizontal-scrolling-menu". To install this dependency, simply run this command:
`npm install --save react-horizontal-scrolling-menu`
5. The modified setting pages didnt have any images right now. I will try to fix this to make it looks better.
